NLP, it stand for Natural Language Processing, is a field in computer science, where focus on how computers can understanding and interact with human language. It's goal is to make computers can understand and respond to text or voice data. But, it's hard because languages is very complex and have many rules that often not follow logic.

In field of NLP, machine learn algorithms is used for make computers can process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The problems is that, even with advanced algorithms, computers often don't understand the nuances, like sarcasm or idioms, in human languages. So, many times, they makes errors when they tries to interpret what a human is saying or writing.
