## Project Idea:

First Deliverable:

- [ ] Names of all team members involved. You may have up to 3 people on a team.
- [ ] Brief description of the project: What problem are you going to try to solve, and why it is important? How does it relate to either your interests or to what we did in this class?
- [ ] At least four (4) resources (blog posts, book chapters, research papers), at least one of which is a research paper published in a journal or conference proceedings.
- [ ] Project Plan: Restate the problem to be solved, specify the data sources you intend to use, what, if any, data wrangling you will need to do, the methods/algorithms you plan to apply, how you will run the project (e.g., on SCC), and the evaluation strategy to use to determine how successfully you solved the problem. Be sure to state, if there is more than one team member, how you will divide up the work.
