# Introduction

Improving oneâ€™s English language writing is a significant challenge without access to proficient teachers that can provide valuable feedback. Given the recent rapid acceleration in generative models ability to understand language, we aim to develop a model/fine-tune a model to provide an interface that will generate feedback given text as an input. Our goal is provide quantitative benchmarks for language proficiency in six different areas: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions in a provided writing. Additionally, we also generate feedback at the inference layers to provide concrete feedback as to how the input text can be improved. To conclude, our project aims to apply the concepts learned in class to a real-world challenge, by providing a interface to acquire feedback on English writing. By focusing on key areas of language skills and providing model generated actionable feedback, we hope to contribute a somewhat practical tool. 

This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based system that can automatically evaluate and provide feedback on student argumentative essays. The system will focus on several key aspects of writing, including the effectiveness of arguments, grammar, use of evidence, syntax, and tone. The feedback can be either quantitative, in the form of scores in various categories, or qualitative, as generated English feedback that offers specific guidance and suggestions for improvement.
