In this passage, Aeneas visits the Underworld and has interactions with Dido and Deiphobus. Aeneas is given passage to the underworld, beyond the styx. This episode is grounded in Homerâ€™s Odyssey where Odysseus speaks to the dead. However, in the Odyssey, Odysseus never actually goes to the underworld, he remains above land and the dead spirits appear and talk to him. First, Aeneas visits the Fields of Mourning, which is where the souls who died for love and those who committed suicide reside.
